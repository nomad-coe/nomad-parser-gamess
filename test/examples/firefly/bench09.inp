! Bench 9
!
! Triplet UHF on tetramethyleneethane.
! In addition to the Dunning/Hay split valence basis with
! d's on carbon, used by Du and Borden, this run has p's
! on the hydrogens.  The DZP basis has 130 AOs.
!
! This molecule consists of two allene units, joined at
! their central carbon atoms.  The dihedral angle between
! the two allenes is about 45 degrees.
! The molecule probably has a singlet ground state, see
! P.Du and W.T.Borden, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1987, 109, 930-931.
!
! The FINAL UHF energy is -231.8224047364 after 13 iterations.
! The S**2 value is 2.383.
