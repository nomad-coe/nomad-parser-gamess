! EXAM 12.
!
! This job illustrates linear bends, for acetylene.
! The optimal RHF/STO-2G geometry is located.
!
! At the input geometry,
! the FINAL E= -73.5036973951 after 7 iterations,
! and the RMS gradient is 0.1506892
!
! At the final geometry, 7 steps later,
! the FINAL E= -73.6046483150, RMS gradient=0.0000080,
! R(CC)=1.1776914 and R(CH)=1.0749434.
