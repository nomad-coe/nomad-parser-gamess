!
! 3-B-1 CH2  ROHF calculation on methylene ground state.
! The wavefunction is a pure triplet state (<S**2> = 2),
! and so has a higher energy than the second example.
!
! This job tests the ROHF wavefunction and gradient code.
! It also tests the direct SCF procedure.
!
! The initial energy is -37.228465067.
! The FINAL energy is -37.2778767104 after 7 iterations.
! Mulliken, Lowdin charges on C are -0.020346, 0.019470.
! The Hydrogen atom spin density is 0.0129735
! The dipole moment is 0.025099 Debye. 
! The RMS gradient is 0.027505564
