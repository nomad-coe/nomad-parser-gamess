! CH2    CI calculation.
! The wavefunction is RHF + CI-SD, within the minimal
! basis, containing 55 configurations.  Two CI roots
! are found, and the gradient of the higher state is
! then computed.
!
! Note that CI gradients have several restrictions,
! which are further described in documentation on the $LAGRAN group.
!
! FINAL energy of RHF = -38.3704885213 after 10 iters.
! State 1 EIGENvalue = -38.4270674277, c(1)  = 0.970224
! State 2 EIGENvalue = -38.3130036870, c(29) = 0.990865
! The upper state dipole moment is 0.708275 Debye (using unrelaxed density).
! The upper state dipole moment is 0.691104 Debye (using relaxed density).
! The upper state has RMS gradient 0.032264083
