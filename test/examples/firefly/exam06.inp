! 1-A-1 CH2    MCSCF methylene geometry optimization.
! The two configuration ansatz is the same as used in
! the fourth example.
!
! The optimization is done in internal coordinates,
! as NZVAR is non-zero.   Since a explicit $ZMAT is
! given, these are used for the internal coordinates,
! rather than those used to enter the molecule in
! the $DATA.  (Careful examination of this trivial
! triatomic's input shows that $ZMAT is equivalent
! to $DATA in this case.  You would normally give
! $ZMAT only if it is somehow different.)
!
! This job tests the MCSCF wavefunction and gradient.
!
! At the initial geometry:
! The initial energy is -37.187342660,
! the FINAL E= -37.2562020654 after 11 iterations,
! the RMS gradient is 0.0256400.
!
! After 4 steps,
! FINAL E= -37.2581791677, RMS gradient=0.0000032,
! r(CH)=1.1243359, ang(HCH)=98.8164093

! Normally one starts a MCSCF run with converged SCF
! orbitals, as Huckel orbitals normally do not converge.
! Even if they do converge, the extra iterations are
! very expensive, so use MOREAD for your runs!
