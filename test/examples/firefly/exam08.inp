! 1-A-1 H2O    RHF + MP2 gradient calculation.
! This job generates RHF orbitals which should be saved
! for use with EXAM9.  This run, together with EXAM9,
! shows a much more typical MCSCF calculation, which
! should always be started with some sort of SCF MOs.
! This job also tests the 2nd order Moller-Plesset code.
!
! The FINAL RHF Energy is -75.5854099088 after 10 iterations.
! E(MP2) is -75.7060362075, RMS grad=0.017449477
! dipole moments are SCF=2.435689, MP2=2.329368
